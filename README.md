# Classic Arcade Game Project

This is a project at Udacity FEND Program. Where I had to create a Classic Arcade Game.


## Instructions to Play:

This is a simple game where the player should reach the water and gain a point, while in the meantime he succeeds in overcoming the enemy which is located in the stone-block area.
* The player is moving only with the arrow keys.
* When the player collides with the enemy, he returns to his starting position and the score resets.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/danijun96/my-arcade-game
